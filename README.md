# Introduction
This project comprises two applications: QT_Drivers App, designed for drivers, and QT_Passengers App, tailored for passengers. The primary objective is to foster transparency between drivers and riders, providing passengers with a curated list of available drivers along with their respective prices for a given destination. This empowers passengers to make informed decisions based on their preferences and convenience.
# QT_Drivers App:
This application serves as a platform for drivers to bid their prices, specify seating capacity, and provide estimated time duration for trips to particular destinations. Through this interface, drivers can effectively communicate their offerings to potential passengers, enabling them to make informed decisions based on factors such as price, seating availability, and travel time.
